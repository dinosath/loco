 # Loco

 #### Loco is strongly inspired by Rails. If you know Rails and Rust, you'll feel at home. If you only know Rails and new to Rust, you'll find Loco refreshing. We do not assume you know Rails.

To get started quickly and see Loco in action, check out our [casts video](https://loco.rs/casts/). It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the framework and see some of its key features in use.

 ## Quick Start
<!-- <snip id="quick-installation-command" inject_from="yaml" template="sh"> -->
```sh
cargo install loco-cli
cargo install sea-orm-cli # Only when DB is needed
```
<!-- </snip> -->

 Now you can create your new app (choose "`SaaS` app").

<!-- <snip id="loco-cli-new-from-template" inject_from="yaml" template="sh"> -->
```sh
❯ loco new
✔ ❯ App name? · myapp
✔ ❯ What would you like to build? · SaaS app (with DB and user auth)

🚂 Loco app generated successfully in:
myapp
```
<!-- </snip> -->


To configure a database , please run a local postgres database with loco:loco and a db named [insert app]_development.
<!-- <snip id="postgres-run-docker-command" inject_from="yaml" template="sh"> -->
```sh
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=loco \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=myapp_development \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="loco" \
  postgres:15.3-alpine
```
<!-- </snip> -->


 A more advanced set of `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfiles` that include Redis and the `mailtutan` mailer are available for [each starter on GitHub](https://github.com/loco-rs/loco/blob/master/starters/saas/.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml).

 Now `cd` into your `myapp` and start your app:

 <!-- <snip id="starting-the-server-command-with-output" inject_from="yaml" template="sh"> -->
```sh
$ cargo loco start
